            unfair or offensive behavior.</li>

        <p><strong>&nbsp;Specific rules for team events: Withdrawal of a team</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>The team will be considered as withdrawn from the team match, if it does not start the first match of a team match
            (walkover) or decides not to finish the team match. If a team withdraws from a team match, the team match will
            be won 3-0 by the opponent.</li>
          <li>If a team is disqualified or withdraws after the draw but before the start of the competition: the team will not

                forfeit (the team match by 3-0, each match by 3-0 and each game by 11-0). The team disqualified will not
                be ranked, the ranks of the remaining teams will be adjusted accordingly, and the ranks of the teams that
                have already finished the competition will be shifted up.</li>
